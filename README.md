# 3D-TC2
This is the official implementation of 3D-TC2(Temporal Consistency Checks to Detect LiDAR Spoofing Attacks on Autonomous Vehicle Perception).

Targeting object spoofing attacks, 3D-TC2 can provide more than 98% attack detection rate with a recall of 91% for detecting spoofed Vehicle
(Car) objects, and is able to achieve real-time detection at 41Hz.

## Requirements
 - CUDA >= 9.0
 - Python 3
 - PyTorch >= 1.1
 - pyquaternion, Matplotlib, PIL, numpy, cv2, tqdm, scipy, scikit-image, scikit-learn, ipython and other relevant packages

## Usage
#### 1. Add path to the root folder. For example:
```
export PYTHONPATH=/your/home/dir/MotionNet:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=/your/home/dir/MotionNet/nuscenes-devkit/python-sdk:$PYTHONPATH
```

#### 2. Dataset
Download [Nuscenes dataset](https://www.nuscenes.org/) to folder: `./data/nuscenes/`. For example, to download Nuscenes mini split:
```
wget https://www.nuscenes.org/data/v1.0-mini.tgz
```

#### 3. Attack the dataset
 - Attack LiDAR scenes in `./data/nuscenes/mini/sweeps/` and customize your own poisoned LiDAR dataset via any data injection attack methods.

 - In our paper, we performed **single-frame injection attack** and assumed historical scenes are not poisoned. To do that, you can randomly pick some scenes from our [Temporally Attacked Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R_VdxMoTULiSSARxmlmkhPIk0CsFTiwQ/view?usp=sharing). 

 - Then replace corresponding benign LiDAR scenes in `./data/nuscenes/mini/sweeps/` . 

 - Note: If you want to replicate our results, please make sure only the scene at the current timestamp is poisoned and relatively historical scenes(past 20 scenes) are benign.

#### 4. Object detection
 - Please feed your poisoned dataset to any kind of 3D object detector and get predictions.

 - Our detection results after running [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet.git) can be found in `./detection` folder.

#### 5. Motion prediction
 - Download MotionNet pretrained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I8WGPuoYeVwUPSPiCrY45IZvdRP2i2Jz/view?usp=sharing).

 - Our preliminary implementation of a 3D-TC2 prototype uses pretrained MotionNet to detect anomalies:
```
python TC2.py --data ./data/nuscenes/mini/ --version v1.0-mini --modelpath model.pth --net MotionNet --savepath log
```

 -  For further details of MotionNet, please refer to the official website [here](https://github.com/pxiangwu/MotionNet).
#### 6. Further exploration
There are some potential directions you might want to further explore:

 - **Temporal attacks**. If you want to perform stress tests on the motion predictor, you can also poison historical scenes to perform consecutive/temporal attacks. To do that, you can select more scenes from our [Temporally Attacked Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R_VdxMoTULiSSARxmlmkhPIk0CsFTiwQ/view?usp=sharing) to ensure historical scenes are poisoned to influence motion predictions for the current scene. 
 
 - **Detecting smaller adversaries**. Our prototype only focuses on 'Car' objects in the front-near region. It might also be interesting to target smaller objects such as 'Perdestrains' or 'Bicycles' in a broader region. 

 - **Other motion predictors**. Other motion predictors such as [FlowNet3D](https://github.com/xingyul/flownet3d), [PointFlowNet](https://github.com/aseembehl/pointflownet) and [HPLFlowNet](https://github.com/laoreja/HPLFlowNet) are also good replacements for MotionNet.
